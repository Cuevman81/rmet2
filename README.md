rmet2 Working Example
================

Background
----------

This package is designed to assist members of the general public with running US EPA's Meteorological Processors, \[AERMINUTE\]\[<https://www3.epa.gov/scram001/metobsdata_procaccprogs.htm>\], \[AERSURFACE\]\[<https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/scram/dispersion_related.htm#aersurface>\], and \[AERMET\]\[<https://www3.epa.gov/scram001/metobsdata_procaccprogs.htm>\]. Rmet2 provides the following features:

-   Automatic Downloading of Meteorological Data from National Oceonographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) websites.

-   Scripted set up of runstream input files to assist in reproducibility.

-   Caputuring output runstreams and files and producing tables and figures useful for air dispersion modelers to perform quality assurance checks on intermediate and final outputs of the meteorological preprocessors.

Example of usage - Corpus Christi, TX

To use rmet2, you will need

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist

    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
